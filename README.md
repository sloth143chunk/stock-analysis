# Stock Analysis		

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this analysis is to refactor code in order to allow Steve to expand the dataset and creating more efficiency.  

## Results

The data shows that in 2017 all the stocks had a higher value in 2017 versus 2018 except for “TERP”. Refactoring the code so you can add more years to analyze has speed up the time it takes for excel to execute as shown in the images.  I have also created buttons that allow you to analyze the data in the “All Stocks Analysis” tab whenever you add new years to your dataset.

## Summary

By refactoring the code, I am able to make the program run more efficiently and allow for it to be reused when new data is added.  The disadvantages for myself were assigning variables and keeping track of the reference throughout the code.

Refactoring can streamline the code and make it less “clunky”.  It also allows the client or user to add new data sets without rewriting the code.  Without comments refactoring can be very difficult for someone else or even myself to understand what I may have been doing.
